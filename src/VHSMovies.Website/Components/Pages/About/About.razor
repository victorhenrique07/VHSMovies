        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our platform! We're dedicated to helping you find the movie you want.</p>

        <h2>How can you ask for recommendations?</h2>
        <p>
            Visit this <a href="/recommendations">page</a> and set the filters according to your preferences. <br />
            You can filter by <strong>genre</strong>, <strong>release date</strong>, <strong>rating</strong>, and more. <br />
            Once you've set your filters, <strong>click</strong> the "Get Recommendations" button to see a list of movies that match your criteria.
        </p>

        <h2>How to use each filter</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Minimum Rating:</strong> Use the slider to set the lowest acceptable rating (from 0 to 10) for your recommended movies. <br />
                <em>Example:</em> If you set it to 7, only movies rated 7 or higher (e.g., “Inception”, “The Dark Knight”) will be included.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Titles Amount:</strong> Adjust how many movie recommendations you want to receive using the slider. <br />
                <em>Example:</em> Set it to 10 to receive a list of 10 recommended movies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Genres To Include:</strong> Select one or more genres you'd like the recommendations to include. <br />
                <em>Example:</em> Selecting “Action” and “Sci-Fi” will prioritize <strong>Action</strong> movies <strong>OR Sci-Fi</strong> movies.

            <li>

                <em>Example:</em> From 2010 to 2020 will only include movies released in that decade, like “Interstellar” or “Parasite”.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Titles to Exclude:</strong> Enter specific movie titles you don’t want to appear in the results. <br />
